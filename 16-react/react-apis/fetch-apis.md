### Learning Objectives
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Identify the pieces of a `fetch()` call
- Create a React component that calls an API


## Introducing `fetch()`

So... we know what an API is. Now what?

How can we use an API to dynamically manipulate the DOM with the given data? We can use `fetch()`.

In the past, these have been called **AJAX** requests. As you'll come to learn, `fetch()` 
allows us to build single page applications that do not require refreshes.

**AJAX**, which stands for "Asynchronous Javascript and XML," is the method through which we are able 
to make HTTP **requests**. The standard requests we will be making are `GET` `POST` `PUT` `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

| Type of Request | What's It Do? |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `GET`  | Read (*'give me movie names from your database'*)|
| `POST` | Create (*'here's a new movie for your database'*)|
| `PATCH` | Update (*'hey, this movie has a new title'*)) |
| `PUT` | Update (*'hey, this movie totally changed'*) |
| `DELETE` | Delete (*'that movie is so bad you should just take it out of the database'*) |

The browser packages this together using `fetch()` and sends it off to a server. The server 
then listens to your request and provides a **response**. It looks something like this:

![Request/Response](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/wdi-23-lessons/raw/master/w08/d4/assets/request-response.png)

When you browse to your favorite websites, your browser is making a request and the server 
is providing a response. `fetch()` allows us to perform the same type of requests over a network. 
Imagine fetching weather information and rendering it on your website. You can use `fetch()` to build these applications.

#### Taking a look at fetch in action

That was a lot! Let's take a look at `fetch()` in action.

Imagine we want to `fetch()` the number of astronauts currently aboard the International Space Station (ISS). 
Good thing there is an API for that, right? This API allows us get the information using the following URL:

```
http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json
```

The API provides a response that looks like the following:

```json
{
	"number": 5,
	"people": [
		{"craft": "ISS", "name": "Oleg Novitskiy"},
		{"craft": "ISS", "name": "Thomas Pesquet"},
		{"craft": "ISS", "name": "Peggy Whitson"},
		{"craft": "ISS", "name": "Fyodor Yurchikhin"},
		{"craft": "ISS", "name": "Jack Fischer"}
		],
		"message": "success"
}
```


> If you'd like, you can copy and paste the API URL into a browser to see this happen.

This particular API tells us the number of people currently in space on the ISS and their names. 
It also happily gives us "message: success" so we know it worked!

We can fetch this JSON easily using Javascript.

How? The skeleton code looks like this:

```js
fetch(url)
  .then(function(response) {
    // Here you get the data to modify or display as you please
    })
  })
  .catch(function(ex) {
    // If there is any error, you will catch it here
  })  
```

Or, in ES6 syntax:

```js
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    // Here you get the data to modify or display as you please
    })
  })
  .catch((ex) => {
    // If there is any error, you will catch it here
  })  
```

Let's look at what we would apply this for our astronauts:


```js
let issApi = 'http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json';
fetch(issApi)
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json()
  }).then((json) => {
    console.log('JSON from the ISS', json)
  }).catch((ex) => {
    console.log('An error occured while parsing!', ex)
  })
```

Let's break this API call down into a few steps.

* `let issApi = 'http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json'`:
First, we define our API URL to fetch from

* `fetch(issApi)`: We call fetch on that API URL.

* `.then((response) => {
	return response.json()`: We take the response when the server provides it. We return the `response.json()`

* `.then((json) => {
	console.log('JSON from the ISS', json)`: We take that `json` and `console.log` it.

* `catch((ex)`: If an error occurs, we catch it and log it.

That's as simple as fetch is. While there are other ways to handle the response (such as `html` or `blob`), 
this approach makes writing requests to APIs and other network calls in Javascript easy.

> *Production Warning!* It is important to note that while this is an ES6 standard, [some browsers such as 
Internet Explorer](http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch) do not support it; yet Edge does. You may need a 
polyfill for live projects. If you need a polyfill for a production project, [Github's polyfill is very popular](https://github.com/github/fetch).


## Codealong - Kanye West Quotes

It is time for you to build a very simple component that shows a randomly generated Kanye West Quote. We'll do 
this using the [Kanye Rest](https://api.kanye.rest/). Before doing so, challenge yourself to a mini quiz.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Which React.Component method should API calls be made from?</strong></summary>
  <br />
  <p>
    <code>componentDidMount()</code>. Per the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount">React documentation</a>, <em>If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.</em>
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: What does it mean to make <code>GET</code> request?</strong></summary>
  <br />
  <p>We are asking the server to send us data to read. To <code>GET</code> means to "read."</p>
</details>

## Fetching Kanye in a React Component

Let's go back to your blog project (so make sure it's running!).

You can use `fetch()` API directly inside of a React Component to render a quote. We'll be using the `Home` component, so 
open `Home.js` to edit.

The official [React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount) tells developers that any 
network requests should be placed inside of the _componentDidMount_ method.
* Start by changing the `Home` component to have an empty `componentDidMount()` method.
* Set the stage for returning a quote in the `div` by changing the text to be an `<h1>` with the text "My favorite Kanyw quote:"

## Let's use axios instead!
`fetch` is great and all... but let's take this opportunity to test out another common library!
`axios` is Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js! More detailed information can be found in their [README on github](https://github.com/axios/axios). 

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class Home extends Component {

  componentDidMount() {
  	/* nothing here... yet! */
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My favorite Kanye quote:</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}


export default Home
```

We can now tell our component to fetch a Kanye quote and then set it to our state. We do this by adding the 
`axios.get()` call inside of _componentDidMount()_.

Calling `this.setState()` then triggers a re-_render_ inside of our component.

You should have this:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

class Home extends Component {

  state = {
    kanye: ''
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    let kanyeRest = 'https://api.kanye.rest/';
    // fetch a poem
    axios.get(kanyeRest).then( response => {
      // set state
      this.setState{kanye: response.data.quote}
    }).catch(err => console.log(err))
  }

  render() {
    let quote = this.state.kanye;
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My favorite Kanye quote:</h1>
        {quote}
      </div>
     )
  }
}
```

Let's test it out!

<!-- You can test it out at this point - it works! -->

* Add an `if` statement under `render`.
  * This simply checks to be sure that `axios.get()` has completed before `render()` tries to return the movie - otherwise it returns "Loading...".
  * For this especially, it's important that the state is declared in the constructor. This way, the `if` statement does not fail if the asynchronous `setState()` hasn't completed the update yet.

```js

render() {
  	 let quote = this.state.kanye;
     if (this.state.kanye){
       return (
         <div>
           <h1>My favorite Kanye quote:</h1>
           {quote}
         </div>
       )
     }
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>My favorite Kanye quote:</h1>
         Loading...
       </div>
     )
  }
```

You're done! Your `home` page should load a random Kanye quote!
